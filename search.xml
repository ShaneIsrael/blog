At the time I was still driving a white 2000 Grand Am and while the car did through college it felt like I needed an upgrade. So around September of that year I bought a 09’ Subaru Outback Sport and it was amazing, it handled well and driving in the winter was a breeze. Now my two main goals ever since I started College were..  </p><pre><code>1. Graduate College2. If successfully completed goal #1. Buy my dream car.</code></pre><p>So because I grew up with a mechanic for a dad, his own thoughts and feelings on what cars are good and what cars are bad were hammered into me constantly. In short my dad has always had a very high respect for Subarus. <strong><em>They last forever!</em></strong>, <strong><em>They are easy to repair!</em></strong>, <strong><em>No car handles better in the winter!</em></strong>, <strong><em>Reliable!</em></strong>, etc etc. Now I have always wanted a fast, cool, sports car and when you think of a fast and cool Subaru; what car comes to mind? A WRX. My dream car to own out of College was a WRX. They look cool, they sound cool, and they have my mechanic dads stamp of approval. </p><p>Now you might be asking <em>Then why didn’t you buy a WRX?</em> Well let me explain… </p><h3 id="How-I-learned-of-the-RS"><a href="#How-I-learned-of-the-RS" class="headerlink" title="How I learned of the RS"></a>How I learned of the RS</h3><p>Somewhere around July and August of last year (2017) I was feeling pretty comfortable at my job having been there for 2 years but still wasn’t really feeling like I accomplished much. I go to work, pay my bills and student loans, etc. I decided to start looking around at dealerships and used car listings to see what there were for WRX’s and STI’s in the area, mostly just playing with the thought of buying one. At around the same time one of my friends and co-workers bought a Ford Focus ST which is a 250HP front wheel drive hot hatch. I didn’t even know Ford had such a performance car, I thought the Mustangs were their performance series and I just don’t really like them. Well after taking a closer look at my friends car I started doing some research on them and thats when I came across the Ford Focus RS.</p><p>The Focus ST is great and all but it has one little problem that I just cant get past. It’s front wheel drive. After having driven an AWD car I’ve decided I will never own a FWD car as my primary vehicle. Doing research on the Focus ST I found its big brother the Focus RS (Rally Sport). The RS is a turbo-charged 350HP AWD hot hatch. Not only that but the AWD system is one of the most advanced out around called “Torque Vectoring”. Basically it allows the computer to shift up to 70% of the power to the rear wheels where it can then shift up to 100% of that 70% to either tire.</p><h3 id="Locating-an-RS"><a href="#Locating-an-RS" class="headerlink" title="Locating an RS"></a>Locating an RS</h3><p>At this point I’m sold, I no longer want a WRX or STI. Partially because they have been using the same engine and AWD system for the last 10+ years. I now want this technological master piece. The problem though, where in Montana can I even find one? Looking around out the major dealers I came up with nothing. Reading the forums I discovered since they are in such high demand any dealerships that do get them will mark the price up by 10-15k dollars. It wasn’t long before I started to give up on finding one near me let alone at a non-marked up price. Just out of curiosity I wanted to see where at the closest RS to me was located so I got on my computer and found an online tool to search all dealerships within a radius. I entered in the information, and chose to sort by nearest. </p><p>Boom. Just 4.5 hours away in Whitefish, MT was a 17’ Focus RS in Nitrous Blue and only 25 miles on it, and the best part? It was listed at MSRP. I jumped at the opportunity. On September 9th, 2017 I had my friend take me to Whitefish where I test drove the car and signed the papers. On the way back we pit stopped at his gran-parents and I took some photos. </p><img src="/2018/03/08/my-ford-focus-rs/20170909_151410.jpg" title="Day #1 with the RS"><p><br><br><img src="/2018/03/08/my-ford-focus-rs/20170909_151401.jpg" title="Day #1 with the RS"></p><h2 id="Initial-Impressions"><a href="#Initial-Impressions" class="headerlink" title="Initial Impressions"></a>Initial Impressions</h2><p>My initial impressions with the car were pure shock and awe. Shock in that I still couldn’t believe I was driving a Focus RS 4.5 hours home. It was definitely one of the most fun cross state trips I have ever done. The amount of power the car put out was insane, it pulled you to your seat when you stepped on it. Having never owned a car with that much power it took me a good 2 hours into the trip before I wasn’t nervous every time I stepped on the throttle. </p><p>The next couple months up into winter I really got to know the car, every single morning I got into the car and drove to work were probably the best parts of the day. The car never stopped being a thrill to drive and still hasn’t too this day <em>albeit its only been 6</em> but I don’t imagine that will change anytime soon. </p><h2 id="Power-Upgrades"><a href="#Power-Upgrades" class="headerlink" title="Power Upgrades"></a>Power Upgrades</h2><p>Since owning the car I have been doing a lot of research into what modifications people are doing to the car. What are the most common mods. etc. What I found was most people upgrade the intake and get a tune put on the car to help smooth out the power band and give it a some extra torque in lower RPM range. </p><p>I found that Ford Performance has a sort of warranty deal with Mountune. Meaning certain aftermarket parts from Mountune will not void your warranty. They also have nothing but fantastic reviews from their customers, and thus I purchased an upgrade intake system and a professional tune from them. The tune is done over email, they send you a tune, you drive on it and data log it, send them back data logs, they make adjustments and send you an updated tune, rinse &amp; repeat. </p><p>I don’t particularly want to go mod crazy on the car and end up destroying it so after doing my research I figure the intake + tune should be more than enough to really bring the car alive. I purchased these in January while they had a holiday sale going on with the intent to install them after I get the headgasket replaced on the car because of the recall.</p><h3 id="Headgasket-Recall"><a href="#Headgasket-Recall" class="headerlink" title="Headgasket Recall"></a>Headgasket Recall</h3><p>Long story short, a small percentage of Focus RS’s built between mid 2016 to mid 2017 potentially need the headgasket replaced. My car just happened to be one of them. I took the car in and they did some testing on it and found that I needed both the headgasket and heads themselves replaced. Fast-forward 2 weeks and I got my car back. </p><p>After driving on it for a couple weeks and keeping a close eye on the coolant I was confident the issue had been resolved and the stonger headgasket was doing its job. So with that being said, I proceeded to install the new intake and the first iteration of the pro-tune. </p><p>Here is the new intake system.<br><img src="/2018/03/08/my-ford-focus-rs/20180307_171245.jpg" title="Cold Air Intake System"></p><h3 id="Expected-Power-Increase"><a href="#Expected-Power-Increase" class="headerlink" title="Expected Power Increase"></a>Expected Power Increase</h3><p>With the intake + tune, this is what Mountune expects the at wheel horsepower and torque to be. My own datalogs are very spot on with what is on this graph.</p><img src="/2018/03/08/my-ford-focus-rs/stock_vs_tuned.jpg" title="Stock w/ parts vs Tuned w/ parts"><p>It may not look like much but its all about the area under the curve. The amount of area gained is huge and very much noticeable when driving. The car feel even better than it did before, way more responsive and quicker with less turbo lag over stock.</p><h3 id="Current-Upgrades"><a href="#Current-Upgrades" class="headerlink" title="Current Upgrades"></a>Current Upgrades</h3><p>Here is a short list of upgrades that are currently installed on the car.</p><ul><li>Mountune High Flow Air Filter</li><li>Mountune Cold Air Intake</li><li>Mountune ProTune</li><li>Boomba BOV</li><li>WC Latheworks    Metal Lathed Shifter</li></ul><h3 id="Future-Upgrades"><a href="#Future-Upgrades" class="headerlink" title="Future Upgrades"></a>Future Upgrades</h3><p>I really only have one future performance upgrade for the car which is the exhaust. The stock exhaust in my opinion has lots of room for improvement in the sound department, its not bad but can definitely be better. An exhaust upgrade wont really add much for power, but will improve the cars personality. Hopefully I’ll be able do it this summer. </p><h2 id="Cosmetic-Enhancements"><a href="#Cosmetic-Enhancements" class="headerlink" title="Cosmetic Enhancements"></a>Cosmetic Enhancements</h2><p>I did purchase a couple cosmetic upgrades to make the car pop even more, nothing too expensive yet. Just some basic vinyl additions and some RS insignia gel inserts for the wing.</p><img src="/2018/03/08/my-ford-focus-rs/cosmetics/20180118_092519.jpg"><img src="/2018/03/08/my-ford-focus-rs/cosmetics/20180307_171548.jpg"><img src="/2018/03/08/my-ford-focus-rs/cosmetics/20180307_171634.jpg"><img src="/2018/03/08/my-ford-focus-rs/cosmetics/20180307_171617.jpg"><p><br></p><h3 id="Future-Cosmetic-Upgrades"><a href="#Future-Cosmetic-Upgrades" class="headerlink" title="Future Cosmetic Upgrades"></a>Future Cosmetic Upgrades</h3><p>There are a few cosmetic upgrades I would like to do in the future, but since cosmetic upgrades tend to be somewhat expensive they probably will happen over a long time span. Mostly some carbon fiber upgrades to help shave some weight off the car and because I really like the look of carbon fiber.</p><h2 id="AutoX-Autocross"><a href="#AutoX-Autocross" class="headerlink" title="AutoX / Autocross"></a>AutoX / Autocross</h2><p>Having a performance car is great but I don’t really feel like I’m getting the most out of it on public roads. I have never done Autocross before but it seems like just the type of thing to really see what this car is made up on a paved course and a great way to improve driving skills. I would be lying if I said I was not nervous for the first Autocross meetup of this year which is only a month from now. Theres not much I can really write on that subject until I have actually done my first Autocross. </p>]]></content>

      <title>FPV Drone Racing</title>
      <link href="/2018/03/06/drone-racing-hobby-1/"/>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Why-I’m-hooked…"><a href="#Why-I’m-hooked…" class="headerlink" title="Why I’m hooked…"></a>Why I’m hooked…</h2><p>FPV (first person view) drone racing is a new hobby and sport that recently has started to gain a lot of traction and attention. So much so that there are now national and international competitions; ESPN even created a Drone Racing League of its own that airs on national television featuring some of the best FPV flyers in the country.</p><p>I got into drone racing during the winter of 2015. I was simply looking for something new to do outside of work since I was finding myself often bored. I started watching these crazy YouTube videos of people flying these drones through obstacles, doing insane tricks, and racing each other; all while making really cool videos.</p><p>Immediately I was hooked and knew this was something I would really enjoy. I did some research on what I needed and ignored some of the advice on getting a cheap basic drone to learn on before purchasing a full fledged racing drone. That was a mistake. I had bought a pre-built $550 drone and thought.. </p><blockquote><p><em>How hard could it be? I watched a ton of beginner flying videos.</em></p></blockquote><p>Well long story short, there is a very high learning curve, I had done maybe 6 or 7 different flights before I tried doing a backflip and slammed it into concrete at a very high speed. The drone was a total loss. </p><p>After that I bought another pre-built drone for roughly the same cost, I figured I had the basics down from my 6 previous flights and decided this time I would take it easy and not do any tricks until I have mastered basic control.</p><p>Fast forward two and a half years of many flights and lots of money spent and I am now fairly confident in my flying ability. However since I live in Montana and there are not really any groups for drone racing here I primarily have been doing freestyle. Freestyle is basically just doing tricks with the drone, flying through obstacles, and pretty much everything thats not racing.</p><h2 id="Building-your-own-FPV-Drone"><a href="#Building-your-own-FPV-Drone" class="headerlink" title="Building your own FPV Drone"></a>Building your own FPV Drone</h2><p>The hobby is not as expensive as you might think, especially now. I started out buying expensive pre-built drones but now I build them myself. There are a ton of tutorials and walk throughs on building your own drone and honestly its half the fun. Knowing that you have a unique drone that you built and are racing around at 90+ mph. A $500 pre-built drone might only cost $150-200 if you built it yourself. </p><img src="/2018/03/06/drone-racing-hobby-1/drone-build/20170814_172713.jpg" title="Parts for the build"><p>All of the parts for my latest build. Carbon fiber frame, motors, camera, flight controller, video transmitter, and receiver. </p><img src="/2018/03/06/drone-racing-hobby-1/drone-build/20170814_220349.jpg" title="Motors and ESC connected"><p>I decided to surround the motors wires in red paracord. These help protect them during crashes and also makes the drone look super cool.</p><img src="/2018/03/06/drone-racing-hobby-1/drone-build/20170814_224229.jpg" title="Flight controller wires attached"><p>At this point I have attached the 4 in 1 ESC (electronic speed controller) and plugged in the wires that will go to the flight controller and the cable for the battery.</p><img src="/2018/03/06/drone-racing-hobby-1/drone-build/20170815_104126.jpg" title="Flight controller wired up"><p>The flight controller goes on top of the ESC. I have soldered all the wires to their respective locations.</p><img src="/2018/03/06/drone-racing-hobby-1/drone-build/20170815_121549.jpg" title="Fpv camera and body attached"><p>I attached the video transmitter, fpv camera, and reciever. At this point the build is basically done. </p><img src="/2018/03/06/drone-racing-hobby-1/drone-build/20170815_142739.jpg" title="Build done"><p>Finally, I put some tri-blades on it and it’s ready for a test flight!</p><p>As you can kinda see, building an fpv drone is fairly simple and there is a lot of online help and walkthroughs. The equipment has also drastically dropped in price, when I started there was only a small handful of choices for the goggles you wear to see from the drone. Those goggles cost me $400, and I still use them today. Because it has become such a popular hobby, there has been lots of competition in the market. You can get decent goggles now for under $100. </p><h2 id="The-End-Result"><a href="#The-End-Result" class="headerlink" title="The End Result"></a>The End Result</h2><p>After many months of practicing, crashing, breaking, and fixing your drone you will eventually get to the point where you can go out and fly for multiple sessions without crashing once. You reach a point where you fully understand your skill level and what you can and can’t do. This makes it infinitely more fun because now you are spending more time flying and less time repairing. Of course, to improve you have to push your limits and in doing so you will occasionally crash; but at this point you should be able to safely practice maneuvers without much fear of crashing.</p><h3 id="Freestyle-Example"><a href="#Freestyle-Example" class="headerlink" title="Freestyle Example"></a>Freestyle Example</h3><p>Here is a sample of a more recent freestyle I did. It doesn’t take long to get the hang of flying them and while you will definitely crash a lot they are very durable and can take some hard wrecks. Just be sure to practice over a grass field rather than a paved parking lot like I did my first time.</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t2EJdNdjLI8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><br><br><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4qGtmTRclqg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><h3 id="Racing-Example"><a href="#Racing-Example" class="headerlink" title="Racing Example"></a>Racing Example</h3><p>While racing takes a bit more practice and I am nowhere near fantastic at it yet; I have improved a lot. I generally set up my own course and practice doing laps as seen in this video.</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/slXES2QTgbM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>]]></content>
